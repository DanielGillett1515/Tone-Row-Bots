# Tone-Row-Bots
The two bots used to create text-only tone rows, one bot used for pitch and one for rhythm and tempo. Both operate the same; just open the application and the set will be automatically generated, and to generate a new set you close the application and reopen it. I have uploaded versions for Windows (32 and 64 bit) but not Mac because the files were too large so if you want those you'll have to get in contact with me directly. Also the "R" and "T" in the rhythm generator specify the rhythms and the tempo portions. Have fun.
